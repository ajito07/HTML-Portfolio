<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ghodke Ajit Rajkumar,and I am currently a student at Alard college of engineering and management,Pune.
   I am majoring in Web devlopment because I have a strong interest in designing and backend . I chose this field because 
   I love to learn about new things.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I'm actively involved in chess club,play several games and like to train my body in gym. 
   These experiences have not only allowed me to develop my body but also to connect my mind with every task i perform
  and chess opens threads in my mind and I think differently by playing such braing game.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy offcourse as I mentioned above playing chess,coding,problem solving,quiz solving and book reading.
   It helps me unwind and provides a balance to my academic life. I also believe in giving back to the community, 
   so I also plant trees and care for animal in surrounding to contribute to causes that matter to me.</p>
